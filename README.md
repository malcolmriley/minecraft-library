# The Paragon's Secret Stash

Yep, it's yet another library mod! This time, to ease and support the development of my own little cluster of mods.

As my projects tend to be for private use, I mercilessly make significant changes to cater to whatever best supports my current set of projects, or simply to satisfy whatever strikes my fancy. Little consideration is given to cross-platform support, so don't think of this as a Serious And Adult Library Mod For Proper Responsible Maven Enjoyers. It is more a Whimsical, Irresponsible, and On-Demand library for one specific my-own-projects enjoyer (me).

Therefore, I wouldn't necessarily recommend trying to use it yourself, but you're more than welcome to take a peek within to see what my way of doing things looks like, and doubly welcome to take inspiration or copy wholesale the parts within you find interesting as per the [code license in this repository](LICENSE-MIT.txt).
